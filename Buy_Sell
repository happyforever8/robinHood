Given a stream of incoming "buy" and "sell" orders (as lists of limit price, quantity, and side, like ["155", "3", "buy"]), determine the total quantity (or number of "shares") executed.

A "buy" order can be executed if there is a corresponding "sell" order with a price that is less than or equal to the price of the "buy" order.
Similarly, a "sell" order can be executed if there is a corresponding "buy" order with a price that is greater than or equal to the price of the "sell" order.
It is possible that an order does not execute immediately if it isn't paired to a counterparty. In that case, you should keep track of that order and execute it at a later time when a pairing order is found.
You should ensure that orders are filled immediately at the best possible price. That is, an order should be executed when it is processed, if possible. Further, "buy" orders should execute at the lowest possible price and "sell" orders at the highest possible price at the time the order is handled.

Note that orders can be partially executed.

--- Sample Input ---

orders = [
['150', '5', 'buy'], # Order A
['190', '1', 'sell'], # Order B
['200', '1', 'sell'], # Order C
['100', '9', 'buy'], # Order D
['140', '8', 'sell'], # Order E
['210', '4', 'buy'], # Order F
]

Sample Output
9

思路：这题老实讲，不难，只是题目意思理解费劲，解题关键是用两个priorityqueue，一个用来存buy的最大，一个用来存sell的最小。

然后扫描，update 两个pq；

/*
Code Review: Money Transfer
 
Since our systems process billions of dollars in trades per week, it’s
important that trade processing and money transfer are error-free.
 
Suppose the code below comes to you for code review. The responsibility of
this code block is to transfer money from one account to another
and send emails to both account owners when the transfer is complete.
 
This code is logically correct. However, given that we operate in the real
world on a distributed system with millions of people transferring money in
and out, what could go wrong? How would you change the code below to
accommodate these failure scenarios?
 
Don't focus on code style or refactoring the code.
 
cache;

master slave;

several servers

only 1 DB;

def bad_transfer(src_account, dst_account, amount):
    lock;
    src_cash = src_account.cash # DB read
    dst_cash = dst_account.cash # DB read
    if src_cash < amount:
        raise InsufficientFunds
    src_account.cash = src_cash - amount # DB write
    src_account.send_src_transfer_email()
    dst_account.cash = dst_cash + amount # DB write
